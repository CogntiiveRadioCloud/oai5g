The Verilog code for the FPGA in the USRP X300 and USRP X310 could be loaded by using uhd scripts
```bash
uhd_image_downloader
```
To load the image:
```bash
uhd_image_loader --args="type=x300,addr=192.168.10.2,fpga=HG"
```
regarding that OAI fetch uhd images to a non-standard location we use the following script including the path, instead:
```bash
uhd_image_loader --args="type=x300,addr=192.168.10.2" --fpga-path="<path_to_images>/usrp_x310_fpga_HG.bit"
```
to check if successfully installed, run
```bash
uhd_usrp_probe
```

Where certain operations may result in corrupting the firmware image, like interapting the loading process:  You have to Recover the device and flash it with a safe image using JTAG Interface.
